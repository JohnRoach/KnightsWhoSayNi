##Knights Who Say Ni##
This program was given as a homework to my intern. It is actually a Knight's tour problem. You can get more information on the problem from [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour#Warnsdorff.27s_algorithm).

I was trying to teach him a lesson on how Brute Force algorithms are not always the best answer.

In the end the lesson turned out quite useful and turned in to a ImageMagick application exercise using the Knight's tour solution using the Warnsdorffs algorithm.

To run this program you will need to install ImageMagick.

In Ubuntu you will need to simply use the command below for installation:

```
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

To run the program simply call:

```
python main.py
```

And asked for position simply enter a chess board position such as "c2" or "a1".

The gif turned out quite cool.

Have fun!
